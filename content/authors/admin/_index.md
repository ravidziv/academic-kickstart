I'm an Assistant Professor and a Fellow at NYU Center for Data Science, New York, where I'm working with Andrew Gordon Wilson and Yann LeCun to understand and develop better models using Bayesian deep networks, information theory, and self-supervised learning.

I completed my Ph.D. under Prof Naftali Tishby's supervision  at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I also worked with Prof. Haim Sompolinsky. In my Ph.D., I focused on the connection between deep neural networks and information theory. I tried to develop a deeper understating of deep networks based on information theory and implement it over large-scale problems. I received the Google Ph.D. Fellowship.

Additionally, I am a researcher at Intel's Artificial Intelligence Research Group. There, I am involved in the development of deep learning, computer vision, and sensory data solutions for healthcare, manufacturing, and marketing, both internally and externally.

In 2019-2020, I worked at Google Brain, CA, USA, exploring DNN generalization using information theory tools.

In the past, I have also been involved in several Wikipedia projects.  I volunteer at The Public Knowledge Workshop in my spare time.

And I also enjoy playing basketball.
