 In these days, I'm  research scientist at Intel. As part of my role I design and implement different Machine learning algorithms.

I also do my PhD. in Computer Science and Neuroscience at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem at the Machine Learning Lab under supervision of Prof. Tali Tishby. My thesis is about learning, information and representations in deep neural networks.

I did my B.A in Computer Science and Bioinformatics at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
I'm did my final project at the Medical Image Processing Laboratory, which I developed Image Processing machine learning algorithms for automatic Identification and analyzes of MRI scans.

I also develop some projects for Wikimedia foundation (mostly Wikipedia) like developing OCR and advanced editing abilities.

When I have a free time I volunteer as web developer at The Public Knowledge Workshop, in several projects.

I especially interesting in machine learning and artificial intelligence, information, Brain- Machine interface and Open Source projects.
