i! I'm an Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow at NYU's Center for Data Science, investigating the frontiers of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). My research bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications, focusing on representation learning, efficiency, and model personalization.

I develop innovative approaches to make AI systems more efficient and interpretable, using information theory to understand neural networks and create novel techniques for model compression and adaptation. This work has been featured in NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, Quanta Magazine, and Wired.

Currently, I also lead AI research at Wand AI, where we're advancing LLM personalization and developing techniques to significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining performance. This combination of academic and industry roles allows me to translate theoretical breakthroughs into real-world impact.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, supported by the Google Ph.D. Fellowship, and previously held research positions at Intel. When I'm not working on AI, I love to play basketball and contributing to open-source projects.
