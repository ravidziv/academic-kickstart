abstract: "Deep neural networks excel in supervised learning tasks but are constrained by the need for extensive labeled data. Self-supervised learning emerges as a promising alternative, allowing models to learn without explicit labels. Information theory has shaped deep neural networks, particularly the information bottleneck principle. This principle optimizes the trade-off between compression and preserving relevant information, providing a foundation for efficient network design in supervised contexts. However, its precise role and adaptation in self-supervised learning remain unclear. In this work, we scrutinize various self-supervised learning approaches from an information-theoretic perspective, introducing a unified framework that encapsulates the self-supervised information-theoretic learning problem. This framework includes multiple encoders and decoders, suggesting that all existing work on self-supervised learning can be seen as specific instances. We aim to unify these approaches to understand their underlying principles better and address the main challenge: many works present different frameworks with differing theories that may seem contradictory. By weaving existing research into a cohesive narrative, we delve into contemporary self-supervised methodologies, spotlight potential research areas, and highlight inherent challenges."
