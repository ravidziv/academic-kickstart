I'm a CDS Faculty Fellow at NYU Center for Data Science, New York, where I'm working with Andrew Gordon Wilson and Yann LeCun to understand and develop better models using Bayesian deep networks, information theory, and self-supervised learning.

I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof Naftali Tishby,  at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where I also worked with Prof Haim Sompolinsky. In my Ph.D., I focused on the connection between deep neural networks and information theory. I tried to develop a deeper understating of deep networks based on information theory and to implement it over large-scale problems. I received the Google Ph.D. Fellowship.


Additionally, I am a researcher at Intel's Artificial Intelligence Research Group.   There, I am involved in the development of deep learning, computer vision, and sensory data solutions for healthcare, manufacturing, and marketing, both internally and externally.

In 2019-2020, I worked at Google Brain, CA, USA, exploring the generalization capability of DNNs using information theory tools.

In the past, I have also been involved in the development of several Wikipedia projects, and  I am a volunteer at The Public Knowledge Workshop in my spare time.


And I also enjoy playing basketball.
